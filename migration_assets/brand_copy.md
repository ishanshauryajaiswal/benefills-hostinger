## Why Benefills Works
*   **Supports Steady Energy**: Selenium & zinc support thyroid hormone function — helping reduce mid-day energy crashes.
*   **Reduces Stress Load**: Ashwagandha helps manage stress, a known trigger for thyroid imbalance.
*   **Made for Busy Lives**: Zero prep. Eat anytime — mornings, work breaks or evening hunger.
*   **Supports Metabolism & Weight Balance**: Key micronutrients often missing in hypothyroid diets, delivered in an easy-to-absorb food form.
