# Operational Guide: Hostinger Website Builder

## ⚠️ MOST IMPORTANT NOTE: DO NOT PUBLISH CHANGES
**CRITICAL**: You must NOT publish any changes to the website by yourself. If you have made modifications in the editor, do not click the "Update Website" button. Instead, notify the user and they will manually review and publish the changes.

## Operating the Hostinger Builder

### 1. Navigation & General Editor
- **Left Toolbar**: Access Pages, Website Styles (Colors/Fonts), Add Elements, and Blog/Store settings.
- **Grid System**: Elements snap to a grid. Be careful when moving items as they may displace others.
- **Mobile Edit**: Always check the mobile view (top toggle) after making desktop changes. Use the "Hide element" (eye icon) to hide specific items on mobile only.

### 2. Store & Product Management
- **Dashboard**: Go to **Online Store** from the left-side toolbar.
- **Products**: Click **Manage products** to edit prices, descriptions, or inventory.
- **Categories**: Use categories to organize products in the shop view.
- **Variants**: For bundles or sizes, use the "Options" feature in the product editor.

### 3. Integrations & SEO
- **Custom Scripts**: Go to **Website Settings** > **Integrations** > **Custom code**. This is where GA4 or Pixel IDs are added.
- **SEO**: Use the **SEO** panel in Website Settings to manage meta titles and descriptions for each page.

### 4. Safety & Recovery
- **Auto-save**: The builder saves changes automatically as you edit.
- **Undo/Redo**: Use `Ctrl+Z` (or the buttons in the top bar).
- **Backups**: You can find "Website history" in the settings to restore to a previous version if something breaks.
