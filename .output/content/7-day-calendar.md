### Day 1: Monday (Carousel)
**Topic:** Why the 3 PM Wall Hits You Harder
**Visual Brief:**
- Slide 1: "Why 3 PM feels like hitting a wall 🧱" (Person slump at desk)
- Slide 2: "Standard wiring: Adrenal dip."
- Slide 3: "Thyroid wiring: Already low RPM + Dip = Crash."

Does 3 PM feel like walking through wet cement? 🧱😩
If you have hypothyroidism, the afternoon "slump" isn't just tiredness—it's a physiological crash.
👉 SWIPE to see why your thyroid makes this dip deeper, and the one tweak to your lunch routine that can fix it.
Spoiler: It involves stabilizing your blood sugar *before* the crash hits.

### Day 3: Wednesday (Reel)
**Topic:** The 2 PM Snack Hack
**Visual Brief:**
- **0-3s:** POV shot of clock hitting 2:00 PM. Text: "Stop the crash before it starts."
- **3-10s:** Opening a jar of ThyroVibe. Spreading it on an apple.
- **10-15s:** Eating it. Text: "Selenium + Healthy Fats + Fiber."

**Caption:**
My secret weapon for the 3 PM slump? Eating at 2 PM. 🕑
By the time you *feel* the crash, it's too late. The key is to fuel your thyroid with steady energy (fats + fiber) an hour before the typical adrenal dip.
ThyroVibe gives you the Selenium you need and the blood sugar stability you crave.

Just a reminder for anyone who felt "behind" this week. 🤍
Brain fog isn't a lack of intelligence. Fatigue isn't a lack of drive.
Hypothyroidism is an invisible weight you carry every day. The fact that you're showing up, doing the work, and pushing through? That makes you incredibly strong.
