| "Great as part of your wellness routine" | "Replaces your thyroid medication" |
| "Consult your doctor about your thyroid" | "Doctors don't understand thyroid issues" |

## Content Formats & Voice Adaptation

### Instagram Posts/Reels

- **CTA:** Encouragement to try, save, or share
- **Example:** "Crashing at 4pm every day? Your thyroid might need more selenium. ThyroVibe packs 55% daily value in every serving—and actually tastes like dessert. 🥜✨"

### Blog/Long-Form
- **Structure:** Story → Science → Solution → Action
- **Tone:** Slightly more educational but still conversational

## Guardrails & Compliance

### Medical/Legal Red Lines
1. **Never claim to cure, treat, or prevent disease**
2. **Always recommend consulting healthcare providers**
3. **Avoid absolute statements** ("will fix your thyroid" → "may support thyroid function")
4. **Disclaim appropriately:** "These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."

### Inclusivity & Sensitivity
- Recognize that thyroid/hormone struggles are deeply personal
- Avoid body-shaming or toxic positivity
- Acknowledge medical complexity (not one-size-fits-all)
- Respect that snacks are *part* of a plan, not the whole solution

## Brand Story (Short Version for Context)

Benefills was born from frustration: thyroid-friendly snacks that tasted like cardboard, or "healthy" bars loaded with sugar and fillers. We set out to create functional snacks that *actually support* thyroid and hormone health—without sacrificing flavor or convenience.

Every ThyroVibe product is crafted with:
- **Selenium & Zinc** (critical for thyroid hormone production)
- **Adaptogens** (ashwagandha, etc. for stress support)
- **No refined sugar** (blood sugar stability matters)
- **Real ingredients** (almonds, dates, cacao, sea salt)

We believe healthy should be easy, tasty, and rooted in science. Thyroid warriors deserve better—and we're here to deliver it.
