## Customer FAQs

### General Questions

**Q: Are ThyroVibe products safe if I'm on thyroid medication?**  
A: Yes! ThyroVibe snacks are made with whole-food ingredients and are safe to eat alongside thyroid medication. However, always consult your doctor or pharmacist if you have specific concerns—especially regarding adaptogens or if you're taking other supplements.

**Q: Can I eat ThyroVibe if I have hyperthyroidism (not hypo)?**  
A: ThyroVibe is formulated primarily for hypothyroid and general hormone support. If you have hyperthyroidism or Graves' disease, check with your healthcare provider, particularly regarding iodine and selenium intake.

**Q: Is ThyroVibe gluten-free? Dairy-free? Vegan?**  
A: **Yes!** All ThyroVibe products are:
- Gluten-free
- Dairy-free
- Vegan
- No soy, no refined sugar, no preservatives

**Q: How much selenium is safe? Can I overdo it?**  
A: One serving of ThyroVibe provides 40-55% of your daily selenium needs—well within safe limits (upper limit is 400mcg/day). We recommend not exceeding 2-3 servings per day and avoiding additional high-dose selenium supplements unless advised by your doctor.

**Q: Do I need to refrigerate ThyroVibe nut butters?**  
A: Not required, but refrigeration keeps them fresher longer. Natural nut butters may separate—just stir before use!

***

### Thyroid-Specific Questions

**Q: Will ThyroVibe replace my thyroid medication?**  
A: **No.** ThyroVibe is a functional snack designed to support thyroid health through nutrition—it is NOT a replacement for prescribed thyroid medication. Always follow your doctor's treatment plan.

**Q: How long until I notice a difference?**  
A: Nutritional support works gradually. Many customers report more stable energy within 1-2 weeks of consistent use, but individual results vary. ThyroVibe is part of a holistic approach (medication, sleep, stress management, nutrition).

**Q: I have Hashimoto's—will this help with antibodies?**  
A: Some research suggests selenium may help reduce thyroid antibodies in Hashimoto's patients. ThyroVibe provides selenium from whole-food sources, which supports thyroid function. However, managing Hashimoto's requires medical care—ThyroVibe is a supportive tool, not a treatment.

**Q: Can I eat ThyroVibe if I'm pregnant or breastfeeding?**  
A: All ingredients are whole-food-based and generally safe. However, check with your OB-GYN or midwife regarding adaptogens (ashwagandha) during pregnancy, as recommendations vary.

***

### PCOS & Hormone Questions

**Q: Is ThyroVibe good for PCOS?**  
A: Absolutely! PCOS management benefits from blood sugar stability, anti-inflammatory foods, and micronutrient support—all of which ThyroVibe provides. The bars and butters are low in sugar (no refined sugar) and rich in protein, fiber, and healthy fats.

**Q: Does ThyroVibe help with weight loss?**  
A: ThyroVibe supports healthy metabolism and stable energy, which can make it easier to maintain a balanced diet and avoid energy crashes that lead to overeating. It's not a "weight loss product," but it's a smart swap for sugary snacks or skipped meals.

**Q: I have insulin resistance—is this safe?**  
A: Yes. ThyroVibe products use dates (low glycemic impact) and no refined sugar. They're designed to provide steady energy without spiking blood sugar. Pair with protein or veggies for balanced mini-meals.

***

### Ingredient & Taste Questions

**Q: What are adaptogens? Are they safe?**  
A: Adaptogens are herbs (like ashwagandha) that help your body adapt to stress. Research supports their use for stress resilience and possibly supporting thyroid function in subclinical hypothyroidism. They're generally safe, but consult your doctor if you're on thyroid meds or have autoimmune conditions.

**Q: Why use dates instead of other sweeteners?**  
A: Dates provide natural sweetness plus fiber, potassium, and antioxidants—without the blood sugar spike of refined sugar. They also act as a binder in our bars, keeping everything together naturally.

**Q: Do ThyroVibe products contain iodine?**  
A: Our products are not specifically fortified with iodine. Most people get adequate iodine from iodized salt and diet. Excess iodine can worsen Hashimoto's, so we avoid adding it unless medically indicated.

**Q: I have a nut allergy—do you have alternatives?**  
A: Currently, ThyroVibe is nut-based (almond, cashew, peanut). We're exploring seed-based options for future releases—stay tuned! (This is an opportunity to ask customers what they'd like to see.)
