# Platform Identification

## Evidence
- **Admin URL pattern**: `https://builder.hostinger.com/...`
  - This subdomain is exclusively used for Hostinger's proprietary AI Website Builder.
  - WordPress installations typically use `hpanel.hostinger.com` or direct `/wp-admin` access.
- **E-commerce Dashboard**: `https://ecommerce.hostinger.com/...`
  - This indicates the native Hostinger Store implementation rather than WooCommerce (which would be managed via WP Admin).
- **Public Site**: `benefills.com` (Confirmed via instructions).
