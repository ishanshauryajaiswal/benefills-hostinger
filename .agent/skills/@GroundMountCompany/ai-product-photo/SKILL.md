# AI Product Photo

Generate professional product photography that sells. Not generic AI images — strategic visual assets that highlight product value, create desire, and convert viewers to buyers.

**Use this skill when:** You need product shots for e-commerce, hero banners, marketing campaigns, or catalogs.
**Route here from:** ai-creative-workflow when product imagery is needed.

---

## Why This Skill Exists
**The problem:** Most AI product photos fail because they look obviously AI-generated, don't follow commercial photography principles, and miss what makes products sell.

**The solution:** A systematic approach that uses proven commercial photography techniques in prompts, optimizes for specific platforms, and highlights product benefits.

## Model
**ALWAYS use Nano Banana Pro via Glif.**
(In this project environment, we use Nano Banana Pro prompts mapped to competitive image generation engines like DALL-E 3 or Google Imagen 3).
