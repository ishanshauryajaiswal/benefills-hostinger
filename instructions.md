# Hostinger Master Companion - Instructions & Runbook

## Executive Summary
Project bootstrap initiated. Platform identified as **Hostinger Website Builder** with native e-commerce. Initial documentation structure created.

## Current Setup
- **Domain**: benefills.com
- **Platform**: Hostinger Website Builder (AI Builder)
- **E-commerce**: Native Hostinger Store
- **Hosting**: Hostinger
- **Known Integrations**: 
  - Razorpay (Payments)
  - Shiprocket (Shipping)
  - Google Analytics (Planned)

## Store Capabilities & Limitations (Hostinger Builder)
- **Pros**: Easy drag-and-drop, integrated essential features, fast setup.
- **Cons**: Less flexible than WordPress/WooCommerce, no custom backend code (PHP), limited plugin ecosystem (integrations are mostly built-in or via code injection).
- **Customization**: Done via "Integrations" settings (Custom Code/Head) or UI settings.

## Operating Procedures
- **Read-Only**: Always explore changes in the editor without publishing first.
- **Publishing**: "Update Website" button pushes changes live.

## Known Risks / TODOs
- [ ] Setup Google Analytics (Priority)
- [ ] Verify existing Razorpay/Shiprocket integration status.
- [ ] Optimize SEO settings in Builder.
