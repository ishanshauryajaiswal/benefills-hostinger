# 🧪 AI Iteration Lab

This directory is the laboratory where we experiment, refine, and perfect our image generation prompts.

## 📂 Structure
Each experiment gets its own folder to keep things organized.

`iterations/iter_[DATE]_[PROJECT_NAME]/`
- `README.md`: The "Lab Notebook". Contains the link, the thought process, the discussion summary, and the final prompt.
- `assets/`: (Optional) Any downloaded inspiration images.
- `generated/`: The actual outputs from our experiments.

## 🔄 The Workflow
1.  **Pick a Target**: Choose an Instagram post you love.
2.  **Open the Lab**: Use `prompts/iterative_analysis.md` to start the session with the AI.
3.  **Dissect**: The AI will analyze *why* the post works visually.
4.  **Hypothesize**: The AI proposes a "Benefills Version" of that prompt.
5.  **Test**: You agree on the prompt. (Code execution or manual generation happens here).
6.  **Record**: Save the results in this folder.

## 🏆 The Goal: "Legends"
When an iteration produces a stunning result, **graduate** that prompt into the `../legends/` content library.
- If `iter_20241025_flatlay` creates a perfect Seeds Bar image, copy that prompt strategy into `../legends/seeds_boost_bar.md`.
- Next time we need a Seeds Bar image, we start with the Legend, not from scratch.
